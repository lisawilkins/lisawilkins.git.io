            <p>I am a Senior UX Designer building apps on OTT and mobile at NBC News Digital in Seattle. My passions are user-testing, reading analytics, agile development, and building close-knit teams who make beautiful products together.

The most successful teams value honest, constructive criticism based on (but not limited to) data and research. The most successful products provide value and are effortless to the end-user.</p>

    				<li>Provide easy-to-access videos and sections.
    					<span class="comment">The majority of users come to the app and sites to view or get additional information on content they have seen on the TODAY Show broadcast.</span></li>
    				<li>Reflect the Bento design aesthetic while staying true to the TODAY Show aesthetic.
    					<span class="comment">Our design system and development structure allowed for us to spin up and entirely new iOS app in a matter of months.</span></li>
    				<li>Open future opportunities for TODAY app ecommerce.  <span class="comment">Show viewers and app users are among our most loyal. User research showed us our users are eager to see what TODAY editorial and TODAY Show programming have tested and given their stamp-of-approval to.</span>
    				</li>
    				<li>Always be committing! <span class="comment">Always be looking for more ways to refine the UX. Continually look for ways to elevate the TODAY Show and NBC News apps in order to differentiate them from other news providers.</span></li>
    				<li>A good idea can come from anywhere. <span class="comment">The developers are skeptical of a proposed solution. The stakeholders point out a missed opportunity.

<!-- ROKU APP -->

            <h4 class="project-name">NBC News channel on Roku</h4>
            <p>
                The NBC News Roku channel is an awesome example of straight–up function. It was quickly made in a few weeks many years ago, using an out-of-the-box SceneGraph Roku interface. A true ugly duckling, but the NBC News app was benefitting from the large Roku market to showcase the amount a video available. The app has also always been a heavy-hitter in regards to the amount of video watched versus any other device NBC News or TODAY is rendered on. It outperforms Apple TV, Amazon Fire, mobile apps, mobile web and desktop across every property. The evolution was, and will continue to be, made with the help of over 700 beta volunteers we recruited to test on our Beta channel. Feedback is solicited via Survey Monkey and email.

            </div>
            <p>
                I had the opportunity to refresh the Roku app, but we couldn't move without understanding why the app was so successful for us. I didn't want to lose a loyal audience who now provides the largest chunk of our video consumption.
                <ul>
                	<li>
                    During the first phase of the refresh I assessed what was keeping our audience from spending more time on the app.
                		<span class="comment">We changed the experience to auto-start the Top Videos playlist instead requiring the user immediately make decisions. Only on TV or a decidedly video experience would I ever want to implement auto-start video.</span>
                	</li>
                	<li>
                		Next I created an area for promoting special features, our featured sections and most importantly, live streaming of breaking news events.</li>
                	<li> Finally, we set up continuous playback.
                		<span class="comment">After the Top Stories playlist is complete the app begins playing the next playlist, a familiar TV experience (the only difference being our 'hey are you still there?' messaging to avoid unchecked data usage).</span></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                These changes, along with a visual refresh increased time spent by over 25%. Continued improvements and releases are ongoing and a design system update is set to be implemented in late 2019.

            <p>I first contracted with MSNBC.com early in my career to write specs. Since that very dull and not-so-creative beginning I was converted to full–time and have worked nearly every design position from daily editorial artist to company-wide design training for a new CMS. Other responsibilities have included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Support the daily editorial efforts; this included producing time-sensitive graphics, illustrative lede images displayed on the MSNBC.com cover and all section fronts.
                </li>
                <li>With another designer, we trained nearly the entire MSNBC Interactive company in the best practices and news design planning with a new curation tool. This included on-site training in New York, Secaucus, Washington D.C. and of course Seattle.
                <li>Worked closely with the editors to create templates for frequently used layouts.</li>
                <li>Created interactives, illustrations and infographics.</li>
                <li>Was active in 3 site-wide redesigns.</li>
                <li>Developed best practices and spec documentation.</li>

            <p>At a small interactive television company (formerly Digeo, now <a href="http://www.arris.com">Arris</a>) I led a team of four designers to create an interface navigated via remote control dPad for DVR and OTT programming and commerce interactions. We delivered solutions to better integrate the normal 10ft passive TV viewing (channel surfing, search, programming the DVR, etc.) with active engagement accompanying shows and their sponsors.</p>

          <p>The process is a rough guideline. The size and deadline (occasionally event driven, such as elections) will determine how many rounds of user testing needed, the level of documentation, the holistic design system, etc.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Review the purpose, potential performance and business goals.
                <span class="comment">Kickoff with stakeholders, product owners, curation tool PM, dev and designers. Assess if we need in-home studies. Leave with goals that are hopefully very SMART (specific and measurable at the very least)</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                Check in with users to assess the current state of the app. Run competitive analysis. Sketch up variations, possible verbiage, and user flow.
                <span class="comment">Review with development for feasibility and product owner to make sure the flow covers all necessary elements.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                If the feature is large or an overhaul I'll print out comps and run some gorilla tests.
                <span class="comment">This feedback will drive iteration. Usually corrections are made and the process moved forward. Very occasionally the changes are larger, and will require retesting with updated designs. This step also includes wireframes so all involved can see how it all fits and if everything is accounted for. If there are larger, conceptual changes I like to gather as much user feedback as possible at this time.</span>
              </li>
              <li>Create prototypes for user testing, and as examples of transitions and navigation for developers.
              <span class="comment">Depending on the scope we will use in-house testing, remote testing or a combination of the two, ideally with interactive prototypes. If interactive isn't possible, I'll provide short clips or movies of the feature. The feedback here will drive further iteration. I also create samples of any transitions to the front-end team.</span></li>
              <li>Document and refine.
                <span class="comment">I call out everything that is a variant of the design system within Figma. Meet with the design staff to review proposed updates, and to solicit any final feedback on how the new features are integrated. This is also when I'll file UI bugs or tasks for necessary refinement on the final product.  At this point an end-date is set (if not set earlier), everyone is pushing towards the goal line, and I'm pressing everyday for the level of visual refinement as created in my designs.</span>
